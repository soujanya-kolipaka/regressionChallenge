# 🗑️ Regression Challenge - Linear Model Interpretability

## Challenge Overview

**Your Mission:** Create a comprehensive Quarto document that demonstrates the dangers of trusting linear models when relationships are non-linear, analyzes the interpretability issues that arise, and presents compelling visual evidence of why we need to be skeptical of regression results. Then render the document to HTML and deploy it via GitHub Pages using the starter repository workflow.

## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## Problem Violating the Assumption of Linearity🎯

> "We need to stop believing much of the empirical work we've been doing." - Christopher H. Achen

**The Core Problem:** When researchers need to 'control for' variables using linear regression, what happens when the relationships are non-linear? 

**What does "control for" mean?** Imagine you're studying whether social media causes anxiety. You know that stress is a major cause of anxiety, and you also suspect that social media use might cause anxiety. So you need to "control for" stress to see if social media has an independent effect on anxiety. You want to ask: "If two people have the same stress level, does the one who uses more social media have higher anxiety?"

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 The Key Insight: Non-Linearity Breaks Even "Good" Regressions

**The problem:** Even when researchers carefully select control variables, non-linear relationships can make linear regression give completely wrong results.

**Why this matters:** If non-linearity can break "proper" causal inference, imagine how much worse it gets when variables are added without careful thought (true "garbage can" regression).

**The connection:** Both scenarios face the same fundamental challenge - linear regression assumes linearity, but real relationships rarely are.
:::

Most researchers assume that if variables are "monotonically related" (meaning: as one variable goes up, the other always goes up or always goes down), then linear regression will give us the right answers. But here's the catch: **linearity is much stronger than monotonicity.**

- **Monotonicity:** A one-unit increase in X always changes Y in the same direction
- **Linearity:** A one-unit increase in X always changes Y by the exact same amount

In practice, we just assume linearity is "close enough" to monotonicity. But what if it's not? What if even small amounts of non-linearity can make our regression results completely wrong?

**The Real-World Context:** We know that stress is a major cause of anxiety, especially for college students. We also suspect that social media use might cause anxiety. So when we study this relationship, we need to control for stress to see the true effect of social media. 

**The Key Problem:** But here's where things get tricky. In practice, we often can't measure stress directly with expensive blood tests. Instead, we use surveys and self-reports. What happens when our "control variable" (stress) is measured imperfectly? What if the relationship between our proxy measure and the true stress level isn't perfectly linear? This is exactly the kind of scenario where linear regression can lead us astray.

**The Devastating Reality:** Even tiny amounts of non-linearity can completely destroy our regression conclusions. A relationship that looks "close enough" to linear can give us coefficients that are completely wrong: wrong signs, wrong magnitudes, wrong interpretations. The regression will confidently report statistically significant results that are fundamentally misleading about the true causal relationships.

Your challenge is to explore the simple example below and show how this happens. Throughout the discussion we will use the following notation:

- **A** &mdash; Anxiety level measured by fMRI activity  
- **S** &mdash; Stress level measured by cortisol level in blood  
- **T** &mdash; Minutes on social media in the last 24 hours

Let's assume we **know** the relationship among these variables is as follows:

`Anxiety = Stress + 0.1 * Time`

::: {.callout-important}
## 🔍 Understanding the True Relationship: Implied Coefficients

**Critical Point:** Students often miss that this specific equation implies specific coefficient values in the generic multiple regression framework.

**The Generic Multiple Regression Equation:** `Y = beta_0 + beta_1 * X_1 + beta_2 * X_2 + epsilon`

**In Our Case:** `Anxiety = beta_0 + beta_1 * Stress + beta_2 * Time + epsilon`

**The True Coefficients (what we "know"):**

- beta_0 = 0 (intercept is zero)
- beta_1 = 1 (coefficient on Stress is 1)  
- beta_2 = 0.1 (coefficient on Time is 0.1)

**Why This Matters:** When we run regression analysis, we're trying to estimate these beta coefficients. If our regression gives us coefficients that are very different from these true values, we know our model is wrong—even if it has good statistical fit!
:::

### The Data Generation Process

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import pandas as pd

# Generate the "true" data with known relationships
observDF = pd.DataFrame({
    'Stress': [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 12, 12, 12],
    'StressSurvey': [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 12, 12, 12],
    'Time': [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.2, 2.2],
    'Anxiety': [0, 0.1, 0.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 2.2, 2.2, 2.2, 8.2, 8.2, 8.21, 12.22, 12.22, 12.22]
})
```

```{python}
#| label: tbl-observations
#| tbl-cap: "Observed data with known true relationships"
#| echo: true
observDF
```

Notice that $Anxiety = Stress + 0.1 \times Time$ indeed holds perfectly. Also, notice the addition of a `StressSurvey` column. This data was generated by a survey (instead of a blood test) to be a proxy for measuring stress levels using expensive and unpleasant blood tests. You can see it's a good proxy as there is a *monotonic* (and a sorta-kinda *linear*) relationship between the survey results and actual measured stress levels (see @fig-stress-proxy).

::: {.callout-note}
## 📝 Methodological Note: The Contrived Nature of This Example

**Important:** This is a contrived example designed to illustrate the dangers of linear regression. In this simulation:

- **Blood test stress levels** have a perfectly linear relationship with anxiety (by design)
- **Survey stress responses** have a non-linear relationship with anxiety (also by design)

In the real world, there is no reason to believe linearity holds for either measurement method. Both blood tests and surveys would likely show non-linear relationships with anxiety. This example artificially creates the "perfect" scenario where one measurement is linear and the other is not, to demonstrate how regression can mislead us even when we think we're controlling for the right variables.
:::

```{python}
#| label: fig-stress-proxy
#| fig-cap: "StressSurvey as a proxy for actual Stress levels"
#| echo: true
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set style
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (7, 4)

# Create the plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(observDF['Stress'], observDF['StressSurvey'], 
        linewidth=1, color='purple', marker='o', markersize=12)
ax.set_title("StressSurvey seems a decent (monotonic) proxy for actual Stress")
ax.set_xlabel("Actual Stress Level")
ax.set_ylabel("Stress Survey Response")
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Grading Rubric 🎓

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 What You're Really Being Graded On

**This is an investigative report, not a coding exercise.** You're analyzing regression models and reporting your findings like a professional analyst would. Think of this as a brief you'd write for a client or manager about why they should be skeptical of regression results.

**Report Format:**

- **Question and Answer Format:** Your final report should be structured as a question and answer document. Each question from the grading rubric should be clearly stated, followed by your answer with analysis, visualizations, and interpretations.
- **Delete All Challenge Instructions:** Once you've completed your analysis, remove all challenge instructions, setup guides, and grading rubrics from your final rendered HTML. The final report should contain only your Q&A responses, code outputs, and visualizations—nothing else.
- **Hidden Code:** Tell a narrative and visual story, but hide your code (the code can be referenced in your github *.qmd source file if needed).
- **Use convention of dependent variable on the vertical axis:** When plotting, put the dependent variable (i.e., Anxiety) on the vertical axis.  Independent variables (i.e., StressSurvey, Stress, and Time) should be on the horizontal axis.

**What makes a great report:**

- **Clear narrative:** Tell the story of what you discovered about regression interpretability
- **Insightful analysis:** Focus on the most interesting differences between true relationships and estimated relationships
- **Professional presentation:** Clean, readable, and engaging
- **Concise conclusions:** No AI babble or unnecessary technical jargon
- **Human insights:** Your interpretation of what the regression coefficients actually mean (or don't mean)

**What we're looking for:** A compelling 4-8 minute read that demonstrates both the power of linear models for interpretation and the critical pitfalls of over-relying on statistical significance in regression analysis.
:::

### Questions to Answer for 75% Grade on Challenge

1. **Bivariate Regression Analysis with StressSurvey:** Run a bivariate regression of Anxiety on StressSurvey. What are the estimated coefficients? How do they compare to the true relationship?

2. **Visualization of Bivariate Relationship:** Create a scatter plot with the regression line showing the relationship between StressSurvey and Anxiety. Comment on the fit and any potential issues.

3. **Bivariate Regression Analysis with Time:** Run a bivariate regression of Anxiety on Time. What are the estimated coefficients? How do they compare to the true relationship?

4. **Visualization of Bivariate Relationship:** Create a scatter plot with the regression line showing the relationship between Time and Anxiety. Comment on the fit and any potential issues.

5. **Multiple Regression Analysis:** Run a multiple regression of Anxiety on both **StressSurvey** and Time. What are the estimated coefficients? How do they compare to the true relationship?

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Remember the True Coefficients!

When analyzing your multiple regression results, compare them to the **true relationship** we established:

**True Coefficients:**

- Intercept (beta_0) = 0
- Stress coefficient (beta_1) = 1  
- Time coefficient (beta_2) = 0.1

**Key Questions:**

- Are your estimated coefficients close to these true values?
- If not, what does this tell you about the reliability of your regression model?
- Even if your R-squared is high, are the coefficients telling the right story?
:::

### Questions to Answer for 85% Grade on Challenge

6. **Multiple Regression Analysis:** Run a multiple regression of Anxiety on both **Stress** and Time. What are the estimated coefficients? How do they compare to the true relationship?

7. **Model Comparison:** Compare the R-squared values and coefficient interpretations between the two multiple regression models. Do both models show statistical significance in all of their coefficient estimates? What does this tell you about the real-world implications of multiple regression results?

### Questions to Answer for 95% Grade on Challenge

8. **Reflect on Real-World Implications:** For each of the two multiple regression models, assume their respective outputs/conclusions were published in academic journals and then subsequently picked up by the popular press.  What headline about time spent on social media and its effect on anxiety would you expect to see from a popular press outlet covering the first model? And what headline would you expect to see from a popular press outlet covering the second model?  Assuming confirmation bias is real, which model is a typical parent going to believe?  Which model will Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok executives prefer?

### Questions to Answer for 100% Grade on Challenge

9. **Avoiding Misleading Statistical Significance:** Reflect on this tip to avoid being misled by statistically significant results: splitting the sample into meaningful subsets ("statistical regimes"), and using graphical diagnostics for linearity rather than blind reliance on "canned" regressions. Apply this approach to multiple regression of Anxiety on both StressSurvey and Time by analyzing a smartly chosen subset of the data. What specific subset did you choose and why?  Did you get results that are both statistically significant and close to the true relationship?

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 For 100% Grade: Focus on What's Most Interesting

**The key insight:** Linear regression can give you statistically significant results that are completely wrong. The challenge is understanding when and why this happens.

**What to investigate:**

- **Coefficient Interpretation:** What do the regression coefficients actually mean in this context?
- **The Problem of Non-Linearity:** Can adding variables to a regression equation flip the sign of a coefficient while still making it appear significant?

**Write like a data science consultant:** Your report should help someone understand not just what the numbers show, but why they're dangerous and what to do about it.

## Essential Regression Concepts 🎯 {#sec-regression-concepts}

Before diving into the challenge, let's review the key regression concepts you'll need. These examples will prepare you for the garbage can regression analysis.

### 1. Simple Linear Regression: The Basics

Let's start with a basic linear regression to understand the mechanics:

```{python}
#| label: simple-regression-python
#| fig-cap: Python simple linear regression example
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)

# Create simple example data
n = 50
x = np.random.normal(10, 3, n)
y = 2 * x + 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, n)

# Fit linear regression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x.reshape(-1, 1), y)

# Display results
print(f"Coefficient: {model.coef_[0]:.3f}")
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_:.3f}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2_score(y, model.predict(x.reshape(-1, 1))):.3f}")

# Create scatter plot with regression line
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 4))
ax.scatter(x, y, alpha=0.7)
ax.plot(x, model.predict(x.reshape(-1, 1)), color='red', linewidth=2)
ax.set_title('Simple Linear Regression')
ax.set_xlabel('X Variable')
ax.set_ylabel('Y Variable')
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 2. Multiple Regression: Adding Complexity

Now let's see how multiple variables interact:

```{python}
#| label: multiple-regression-python
#| fig-cap: Python multiple regression example
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(456)

# Create multiple regression example
n = 50
x1 = np.random.normal(10, 3, n)
x2 = np.random.normal(5, 2, n)
y = 2 * x1 + 0.5 * x2 + 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, n)

# Fit multiple regression
X = np.column_stack([x1, x2])
model_multi = LinearRegression()
model_multi.fit(X, y)

# Display results
print(f"Coefficients: {model_multi.coef_}")
print(f"Intercept: {model_multi.intercept_:.3f}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2_score(y, model_multi.predict(X)):.3f}")

# Create pairs plot
data_df = pd.DataFrame({'x1': x1, 'x2': x2, 'y': y})
sns.pairplot(data_df)
plt.suptitle('Pairs Plot: Multiple Regression Variables', y=1.02)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Statistical Significance at 5% Level

A coefficient is **statistically significant** when its p-value is less than 0.05.

- **p < 0.05**: Statistically significant
- **p ≥ 0.05**: Not statistically significant

### Understanding Scientific Notation in P-values

Sometimes you'll see p-values written in scientific notation like `7.89e-4`. Don't panic! This is just a way to write very small numbers:

- **7.89e-4** means 7.89 × 10⁻⁴ = 0.000789
- **2.34e-6** means 2.34 × 10⁻⁶ = 0.00000234
- **1.23e-2** means 1.23 × 10⁻² = 0.0123

**The key rule:** If you see "e-" in a p-value, it's always a very small number (less than 1). The number after "e-" tells you how many zeros come before the first non-zero digit.

**Examples:**
- 7.89e-4 = 0.000789 (less than 0.05, so significant!)
- 2.34e-6 = 0.00000234 (way less than 0.05, so very significant!)
- 1.23e-2 = 0.0123 (less than 0.05, so significant!)

**Remember:** Statistical significance doesn't mean the effect is large or important - it just means we're confident the effect isn't zero.
:::

## The Problem of Non-Linearity: A Deeper Look

The "garbage can regression" problem occurs when we include variables in our regression models that create misleading results, even when they appear statistically significant. This happens in several ways:

1. **Random correlations:** Even random variables can appear correlated by chance
2. **Overfitting:** More variables can improve fit without improving understanding
3. **Multiple testing:** The more variables we test, the more likely we are to find spurious relationships
4. **Non-linear relationships:** Variables with U-shaped, exponential, or other non-linear relationships with the outcome are forced into a linear framework, creating misleading coefficients

### Why This Matters

In the real world, non-linear relationships can lead to:

- **False policy recommendations:** Basing decisions on spurious correlations or false causal relationships
- **Wasted resources:** Pursuing interventions that don't actually work
- **Loss of credibility:** When results can't be replicated or don't make sense
- **Ethical issues:** Making decisions that affect people's lives based on bad science

### The Solution

The key is to always ask:

1. **Does this make theoretical sense?** Is there a plausible mechanism?
2. **Is the relationship robust?** Does it hold across different samples and specifications?
3. **Are we overfitting?** Do we have enough data relative to the number of variables?
4. **Can we interpret the coefficients?** Do the results tell a coherent story?
5. **Is the relationship truly linear?** Check for non-linear patterns that linear regression can't capture
6. **Are we forcing the wrong functional form?** Consider if polynomial terms, interactions, or transformations are needed
7. **Split the sample into meaningful subsets:** Analyze different "statistical regimes" to see if relationships hold consistently across different parts of your data
8. **Use graphical diagnostics:** Don't rely blindly on "canned" regressions—visualize the relationships to understand what's really happening

Remember: **Correlation is not causation, and regression coefficients can lie!** 📊
